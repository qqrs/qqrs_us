If you can’t do that, an easel will work. You can also use thumbtacks or low-tack tape (artist’s tape).\nTake it out of the frame if you can to prevent glare and reflections. If you can’t, you can use black foam core to either side of the camera to block light from the room.\nFor unframed posters that curl up, you can use a magnetic poster hanger. Or do the best you can with weights on the corners, shooting from above.\nLighting\nEven lighting is the most important thing. If you’re an artist and serious about taking photos of your artwork, you should probably spring for some $$$ lighting. But here are the $ options.\n\nYou could shoot outside and use the sun\nYou can shoot inside and use lights\n\nThe downside of shooting outside is you need to wait for the right conditions. Rainy days won’t work. You want a sunny day but some diffusion from the atmosphere is helpful. Direct sunlight may be too bright. Some people shoot under a porch or at the edge of their garage. Trees probably won’t work since they cast uneven shadows.\nShooting inside gives you more control. Block the windows and turn off the overhead lights. You want two lights. They should be identical and placed symmetrically. Place them either side of the artwork at a 30-45 deg angle to the wall, at the same height as the camera. Make sure you aren’t seeing a reflection from the lights.\nClamp lights from the hardware store are cheap. They can be mounted on chairs. I’ve seen a recommendation to use 100W incandescent soft white bulbs, but the incandescents I bought were casting uneven light. Now that they’re being phased out it may be hard to find good quality incandescents. I settled on using a 100W LED bright white (3000K color temperature) bulbs.\nCamera\n\n\nMount the camera on a tripod and position it square to the artwork. Use a remote trigger or self timer to take the shot. This way you can use a longer shutter speed if needed without worrying about motion blur.\n\n\nStart off setting the white balance appropriately for your light source. If you have a gray card, use it. If not, choose the incandescent or sunlight option, as appropriate.\n\n\nUse the lowest ISO setting available (100 or 200). This will minimize noise. If you don’t have enough light for proper exposure, you can bump it up later, but hopefully you’ll have headroom to increase shutter speed so it won’t be necessary.\n\n\nSet the camera mode to aperture priority. (It may make sense later to use manual mode and dial in a shutter speed to get repeatable shots.)\n\n\nSet the aperture pretty narrow, somewhere from f/11 — f/16. A wide aperture results in a shallow depth-of-field, which actually isn’t too bad—the canvas is flat, after all. But starting with a narrow aperture is best to ensure that the finest details stay sharp.\n\n\nAt this point you can probably start shooting. You should check that the exposure and focus are ok. If they aren’t, here are some tricks:\n\n\n(Optional) If the artwork is very light or dark and you want to preserve that effect in the photo, you can use a grey card (or newspaper with big black X) as a neutral target for exposure and focusing. Trigger the camera self-timer and remove the newspaper before each shot.\n\n\n(Optional) If you want repeatable shots, you can switch to manual mode and dial in the shutter speed once you’ve seen what the camera has been selecting automatically. If you’re having trouble with the focus changing, you can also focus manually.\n\n\nReferences\nwww.vmfa.museum/teens/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2014/02/How_to_shoot_art-FINAL.pdf\nartprof.org/pro-development/art-school-portfolios/art-school-portfolios-photographing-2d-art/\nexpertphotography.com/photographing-artwork-tips/\nStitching photos\nIf you can’t get a high enough resolution in one photo, you can stitch multiple photos.\nI only tried this once and results weren’t perfect.

Highly recommended for development.\nNote that the Pico with pre-soldered headers has a JST connector for the SWD debug port, but the Pico without headers doesn’t. You’ll need to solder on header pins to use SWD.\nserial debugging\nGood old printf debugging works.\nprintf(&quot;Hello, world!\\n&quot;);\n\nUART\nBy default, stdio is directed to UART. You can connect with the Debug Probe or any other usb-to-serial TTL level adapter (FTDI, etc.).\nRX/TX/GND connect to pins 1/2/3 on the Pico. See diagram.\nbrew install minicom\n\nls /dev/tty.usbmodem*\n\nminicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/tty.usbmodem2302    # or similar name\n# or alternative: screen /dev/tty.usbmodem2302 115200\n\nUSB\nYou can also redirect stdio to USB. The Pico has built-in support to emulate a virtual serial port over its USB port. This way all you need is a USB cable.\nThe hello_world example shows how you would configure the CMakeLists.txt. It would look something like this:\n# enable usb output, disable uart output\npico_enable_stdio_usb(hello_usb 1)\npico_enable_stdio_uart(hello_usb 0)\n\npicotool\nquery and program Pico via USB\nSee first:\n\nGetting Started with the Raspberry Pi Pico Appendix B\ngithub.com/raspberrypi/picotool\n\nyou must first reboot while holding the BOOTSEL button or\n\nas of version 1.1 of picotool it is also possible to interact with Raspberry Pi microcontrollers that are not in BOOTSEL mode, but are using USB stdio support from the SDK by using the -f argument of picotool.\n\nbrew install picotool\n\nuseful commands to try\npicotool info\npicotool info -a\npicotool load blink.uf2\npicotool reboot\n\nhandy way to reboot into BOOTSEL mode\n(Note: only works if the loaded program is configured for USB stdio.

I followed instructions from this video.

The pico C SDK includes MQTT support as part of lwIP, its TCP/IP stack.\n\nwww.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/networking.html\n\nMQTT concepts:\n\nconnect\nsubscribe\npublish\nreceive\n\nThere isn’t much documentation on the pico side, but the key piece is adding pico_lwip_mqtt to the target_link_libraries directive in CMakeLists.txt.\ntarget_link_libraries(project_name_here\n\t...\n\tpico_lwip_mqtt\n)\n\nlwIP MQTT\nAside from that, everything needed is there if you dig around a little in the lwIP API docs and source code:\n\nwww.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/group__mqtt.html\nlwip/src/apps/mqtt/mqtt.c\nlwip/src/include/lwip/apps/mqtt.h\n\nThere’s also a short lwIP MQTT example with a pretty good tutorial:\n\nlwip/contrib/examples/mqtt/mqtt_example.c\nlwip/doc/mqtt_client.txt\n\nThe tutorial walks through the important stuff. It also mentions this caveat:\n\nYou need to increase MEMP_NUM_SYS_TIMEOUT by one if you use MQTT!\n\nMEMP_NUM_SYS_TIMEOUT is the number of simultaneously active timeouts.\nSee also: pico-sdk issue #1106 issue #1725\nThere’s no MQTT in the pico-examples repo, so I found an example on Github that made a good starting point. I had to fiddle with the CMakeLists.txt to get it to pick up the WiFi config, but got it working pretty quickly.\n\ngithub.com/cniles/picow-iot\n\nI did some refactoring to make the code manageable (happy path to the left margin, etc etc) and triangulated with the lwIP tutorial. That was the base I built on.\nMQTT testing\nYou need an MQTT broker to connect to for testing. You can use the publicly available test server at test.mosquitto.org, you can install and run mosquitto locally, or you can use Adafruit I/O (free for basic plan).\nSee:\n\nAdafruit IO MQTT API Connection Details\n\n\nHost: io.adafruit.com\nPort: 1883 or 8883 (for SSL encrypted connection)\nUsername: your Adafruit account username\nPassword: your Adafruit IO key (click the AIO Key button on a dashboard to find the key)\n\nwith feed names\n\n(username)/feeds/(feed name or key)\n(username)/f/(feed name or key)\n\nAdafruit IO does not support MQTT v5 so I used v3.1.1 to connect.\nI also used MQTTX, a cross-platform desktop MQTT client. The UI is a little clunky. If I was going to use it a lot, I’d look for something nicer.\nHMAC signing\nTODO: this section is WIP\nHMAC stands for hash-based message authentication code. It’s a scheme for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a received message.\nThe pico C SDK has support for calculating and verifying HMACs as part of Mbed TLS, an SSL/TLS implementation that includes cryptographic algorithms.\nThe key piece is adding pico_mbedtls to the target_link_libraries directive in CMakeLists.txt.\ntarget_link_libraries(project_name_here\n\t...\n\tpico_mbedtls\n)\n\nNote that the PSA APIs should be used for new development.\nTODO:\nmbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/psa/#hashing-a-message\nThere is example code for working with HMACs using the PSA API:\n\nprograms/psa/hmac_demo.c\n\nSee API reference docs:\n\narm-software.github.io/psa-api/crypto/1.2/api/ops/macs.html\nmbed-tls.readthedocs.io/projects/api/en/development/api/group/group___m_a_c/\n\nHardware hashing\nThe RP2350 chip has hardware support for SHA-256.\nC SDK pdf\n\nTo use this in mbedtls you need to define MBEDTLS_SHA256_ALT in your mbedtls_config.h. Use LIB_PICO_SHA256 to check if hardware SHA256 is supported and fallback to defining MBEDTLS_SHA256_C for the software SHA256 calculation.\n\nmbedtls_sha256/mbedtls_config.h example:\n#if LIB_PICO_SHA256\n// Enable hardware acceleration\n#define MBEDTLS_SHA256_ALT\n#else\n#define MBEDTLS_SHA256_C\n#endif\n\nBenchmarking with pico-examples/sha/mbedtls_sha256, it takes ~950 ms to hash 1 MB on RP2040 in software vs. ~430 ms in software on RP2350 vs. ~30 ms in hardware on RP2350.\nbase64\nbase64 is a scheme for encoding binary data using only 64 printable text characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and /.\nThere is pico support for base64 encoding and decoding via the mbedtls libraries. To use it, link the pico_mbedtls library and include mbedtls/base64.h.\nmbed-tls docs:\nint mbedtls_base64_decode(unsigned char *dst, size_t dlen, size_t *olen, const unsigned char *src, size_t slen)\n\ntimers\ngithub.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/timer/hello_timer/hello_timer.c\nwww.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/high_level.html#group_alarm\ntime\nsince boot\nto get the number of milliseconds since power-up\nto_ms_since_boot(get_absolute_time());\n\nalways on timer\nRP2350 datasheet:\n\nThe RP2040 Real Time Clock (RTC) is not used in RP2350. Instead, RP2350 has a timer in the Always-On power domain which is used for scheduling power-up events and can also be used as a real-time counter. The AON Timer works differently from the RP2040 RTC. It counts milliseconds to 64 bits and this value can be used to calculate the date and time in software if required.\n\ntarget_link_libraries(\n\t...\n\tpico_aon_timer\n)\n\nprintf(&quot;aon running=%d\\n&quot;, aon_timer_is_running());\n\n    struct timespec ts;\n    ts.tv_sec = 10;\n    aon_timer_start(&amp;ts);\n\n    printf(&quot;aon running=%d\\n&quot;, aon_timer_is_running());\n\n    while (1) {\n        sleep_ms(3000);\n        aon_timer_get_time(&amp;ts);\n        printf(&quot;aon time=%d tv_sec=%d tv_nsec=%d\\n&quot;, timespec_to_ms(&amp;ts), ts.tv_sec, ts.tv_nsec);\n    }\n\n\npowman timer\nUnit testing\nYouTube: C/C++ Unit Testing on Raspberry PI Pico\nGithub: RPIPicoCPPUTest\n\nTemplate Project for CPPUTest on Raspberry PI Pico\n"},"index":{"title":"hello","links":["howto/archiving/artwork","howto/hobbies/ham-radio","howto/sysadmin/password-manager","swhack/milkdrop","swhack/strafejumping","hwhack/embedded/raspberry-pi-pico","swhack/T3100e-vintage-computer","index.xml"],"tags":[],"content":"   under construction :)   \na window into my personal knowledge base\nwhat\nit’s a digital garden\nthere are hundreds of notes in my private repo\nall edited with obsidian—and I’m aiming to publish many of them\nwhoami\ni’ve got a pretty good nose\ni was an electrical engineer in a past life\ni always seem to come back to that one Heinlein quote\nmy poems don’t come out as sonnets, though\nwhere to start?\n← if your window is wide enough you’ll see a file explorer to the left\nthis is just a beginning; you can read about archival photos of artwork… getting started with ham radio… password manager recommendations… milkdrop music visualization… quake 3 strafejumping… getting started with raspberry pi pico… loading a C compiler onto a T3100e vintage computer…\nyou can subscribe to the RSS feed"},"swhack/T3100e-vintage-computer":{"title":"T3100e vintage computer","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Toshiba T3100e is a “luggable” PC-compatible computer introduced in 1988.\nIt has an Intel 80286 CPU, 1 MB RAM, 20 MB hard disk, 3.5” floppy drive, and a stunning 640x400 orange monochrome gas-plasma display.

Then I followed instructions in the milkdrop.co.uk tutorial to create a blank preset with sensible defaults:\n\nSo the initial advice is simple create a blank preset with no zoom, no rot, no warp, no colours, etc. And here is one created for you.\n[preset00]\nfRating=3.000000\nfGammaAdj=1.000000\nfDecay=0.925000\n...\n\n\nConcepts\n\nper-frame vs. per-vertex equations\nwave_mode\n\nWaveformMode.hpp\nwave_mystery\n\n\ndecay\nvariables\n\nzoom, rot, warp, cx/cy, dx/dy, sx/sy\ntime, frame\nbass, mid, treb, bass_att, mid_att, treb_att\n\n\nper-vertex variables\n\nrad, ang, x, y\n\n\n\nCustom shapes and waves\nTODO\nShaders\nTODO\nMilkdrop uses Direct3D HLSL\nwarp shader, composite shader\nwww.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/milkdrop_preset_authoring.html#3f\nprojectM glsl\nspiegelmock.com/2018/07/29/projectm-opengl-and-shader-modernization/\nBeat detection\nmilkdrop.co.uk tutorial Section 9.5 Tutorial 4 - Shift\n\nThe fourth tutorial covers the preset “Shift”. This preset introduces a commonly used method of beat detection, which can be easily transported across into other presets.\n\n\nIF bass_att is greater than bass_thresh  \nTHEN set bass_thresh to 2  \nELSE do (stuff)  \nENDIF\n\n\n\nNow, we need to focus on what that (stuff) part does. I’ve reproduced it here:\n(bass_thresh - 1.3)*0.96 + 1.3\n\n\nA plain english version of the equation is:\n“Take 96% of the difference between bass_thresh and 1.3, and add it to 1.3”\nThis generates an exponential/log curve\n\n\nThis means that the bass_thresh value will start at a point (in this case, 2), and drop. The value will drop relatively quickly at first, but will slow down; eventually getting so close to 1.3 that it IS 1.3.\nSo what happens then? Well, at some point, the bass_att (which is the percentage of the bass in this frame relative to the last frame) will be above our threshold, and the threshold will be set to 2 again. Incidentally, this is the same way that MilkDrop detects beats for its “Hard Cuts”.\n\n\nIF bass_thresh = 2 (i.e. we have just detected a beat) \nTHEN set dx_residual to 0.016*sin(time*7) (which is essentially a random number between -0.016 and 0.016) \nELSE keep dx_residual the same (multiplying itself by 1) \nENDIF \n\nThe dy_residual equation works in the same way. The three lines of code are therefore generating two random numbers between -0.016 and 0.016 every time we detect a beat.\n\nSee also:\nimproved beat detection\nforums.winamp.com/forum/visualizations/milkdrop/milkdrop-development/4622543-the-real-milkdrop-s-perfect-beat-detection#post4622699"},"swhack/strafejumping":{"title":"strafejumping","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Strafe-jumping is a movement technique in Quake 3 that allows the player to move much faster than the nominal run speed.\nIt was discovered as a bug in Quake II and fans liked it so much id software carried it forward to subsequent games.\nwhy it’s fun\nI played a lot of Quake 3 engine games, in particular Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force. Once you develop muscle memory for strafe jumping it’s extremely satisfying.\nThere’s a rhythm to it, and it feels like you’re running, one footfall after another. You drop into a flow state where everything else fades away—but if your attention wavers and you miss a beat, you stumble and kill your momentum.\nIt takes a lot of skill to keep up your speed while dodging enemies and returning fire. You only get a split second between strides to aim and take a shot before snapping back to the strafe.\nwhat and how\nYouTube: Quake Champions: All strafe jumping techniques\nConcept: Strafe Jumping\n\nA proper strafe jump within Quake 3 can increase your UPS from 320 to over 600.\n\n\n\nPress the forward key\nPress the jump and left or right strafe key at the same time\nWhile in the air move the mouse in the direction of the strafe\nJump immediately after landing\n\n(Repeat steps two and three, alternating the strafe and turn with each jump.)\n\n\nWhen landing, the player must jump immediately afterwards or else the ground friction will slow them down. When jumping, the player is unaffected by ground friction.\n\nreddit: How to practice strafe-jumping?:\n\nThe most important thing is to synchronize your mouse movement with holding A+W or D+w. Once you land, jump again and switch directions, and always keep your eyes on the speedometer. The key is not to make huge movements, just SLIGHTLY, SMOOTHLY move your mouse in the direction of the strafe key you’re pressing and you will accelerate.\nOnce you get this down, try going into a game with bots. When aiming while strafejumping (while you’re in the air i mean) let go of all movement keys, hold space and look where you want, then look back to where you want to go. When you land you will immediately jump since you’re holding space. after you jump start pressing w and corresponding strafe keys again.\n\nstrafe jumping physics\nHow is strafe jumping implemented in the game engine physics code?\ntl;dr:\nre: acceleration… instead of limiting speed directly, only the component of velocity in the direction of acceleration is limited\nwhy? it feels better if the player can accelerate sideways relative to their current velocity without killing their forward momentum\nas a result there is no hard cap on speed… i.e., continuous acceleration is possible\nbut there are diminishing returns as greater and greater strafe-jumping precision is required to continue adding speed\nalso necessary: there is a one-frame window where friction is not applied after landing from a jump… without this, friction would bleed off any excess speed\nacceleration code\nQuake III bg_pmove.c:\n/*\n==============\nPM_Accelerate\n\nHandles user intended acceleration\n==============\n*/\nstatic void PM_Accelerate( vec3_t wishdir, float wishspeed, float accel ) {\n#if 1\n\t// q2 style\n\tint\t\t\ti;\n\tfloat\t\taddspeed, accelspeed, currentspeed;\n\n\tcurrentspeed = DotProduct (pm-&gt;ps-&gt;velocity, wishdir);\n\taddspeed = wishspeed - currentspeed;\n\tif (addspeed &lt;= 0) {\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\taccelspeed = accel*pml.frametime*wishspeed;\n\tif (accelspeed &gt; addspeed) {\n\t\taccelspeed = addspeed;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfor (i=0 ; i&lt;3 ; i++) {\n\t\tpm-&gt;ps-&gt;velocity[i] += accelspeed*wishdir[i];\t\n\t}\n#else\n\t// proper way (avoids strafe jump maxspeed bug), but feels bad\n\t...\n#endif\n}\n\nparameters:\nwishdir and wishspeed are the normalized unit vector and magnitude, respectively, of wishvel\nsomewhat confusingly, wishspeed is used as both the target velocity in the direction wishdir and as a base acceleration value\nmore confusingly, accel is not the acceleration, it’s a multiple used to adjust acceleration based on conditions (land, air, water, flying)\nacceleration is calculed as accel \\times wishspeed\naccel values:\nfloat\tpm_accelerate = 10.0f;\nfloat\tpm_airaccelerate = 1.0f;\nfloat\tpm_wateraccelerate = 4.0f;\nfloat\tpm_flyaccelerate = 8.0f;\n\nvariables:\nnaming is pretty loose\ne.g., currentspeed isn’t the magnitude of pm-&gt;ps-&gt;velocity as you might expect; it’s the component of the current velocity in the direction of wishdir\npseudocode\n\\vec{v} = \\texttt{pm-&gt;ps-&gt;velocity}\n\\vec{w} = \\|w\\| \\times \\hat{w} = \\texttt{wishspeed} \\times \\texttt{wishdir}\na_{max} = \\texttt{accel} \\times \\texttt{wishspeed}\ndt = \\texttt{pml.frametime}\n# component of current velocity in the direction of wishdir\nv_w = \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{w}\n\\texttt{if}\\ v_w \\geq \\|w\\|:\n# do nothing if it&#039;s already larger than wishspeed\nreturn\n# nominal change in velocity in the direction of wishdir\ndv = a_{max} \\times dt\n# don&#039;t overshoot wishspeed\ndv_{max} = \\|w\\| - v_w\ndv = \\min(dv, dv_{max})\n# update velocity\n\\mathrel{\\texttt{pm-&gt;ps-&gt;velocity +=}} dv \\times \\hat{w}\nfurther reading\nBunnyhopping from the Programmer’s Perspective\nYouTube: Strafe-jumping physics explained\n\ngreat visualization but pseudocode and explanation are not exactly correct\nsee detailed comment by @MistorDi:\n\nStack Exchange: Implementing strafe jumping\n\ndiscusses “Strafing Theory” by injx\n\nreddit: Fully interactive strafejumping visualization tool\nWhat is Strafe Jumping? by Dylan Lederle-Ensign &amp; Noah Wardrip-Fruin in Transactions of the Digital Games Research Association"}}
