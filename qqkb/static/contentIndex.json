If you can’t do that, an easel will work. You can also use thumbtacks or low-tack tape (artist’s tape).\nTake it out of the frame if you can to prevent glare and reflections. If you can’t, you can use black foam core to either side of the camera to block light from the room.\nFor unframed posters that curl up, you can use a magnetic poster hanger. Or do the best you can with weights on the corners, shooting from above.\nLighting\nEven lighting is the most important thing. If you’re an artist and serious about taking photos of your artwork, you should probably spring for some $$$ lighting. But here are the $ options.\n\nYou could shoot outside and use the sun\nYou can shoot inside and use lights\n\nThe downside of shooting outside is you need to wait for the right conditions. Rainy days won’t work. You want a sunny day but some diffusion from the atmosphere is helpful. Direct sunlight may be too bright. Some people shoot under a porch or at the edge of their garage. Trees probably won’t work since they cast uneven shadows.\nShooting inside gives you more control. Block the windows and turn off the overhead lights. You want two lights. They should be identical and placed symmetrically. Place them either side of the artwork at a 30-45 deg angle to the wall, at the same height as the camera. Make sure you aren’t seeing a reflection from the lights.\nClamp lights from the hardware store are cheap. They can be mounted on chairs. I’ve seen a recommendation to use 100W incandescent soft white bulbs, but the incandescents I bought were casting uneven light. Now that they’re being phased out it may be hard to find good quality incandescents. I settled on using a 100W LED bright white (3000K color temperature) bulbs.\nCamera\n\n\nMount the camera on a tripod and position it square to the artwork. Use a remote trigger or self timer to take the shot. This way you can use a longer shutter speed if needed without worrying about motion blur.\n\n\nStart off setting the white balance appropriately for your light source. If you have a gray card, use it. If not, choose the incandescent or sunlight option, as appropriate.\n\n\nUse the lowest ISO setting available (100 or 200). This will minimize noise. If you don’t have enough light for proper exposure, you can bump it up later, but hopefully you’ll have headroom to increase shutter speed so it won’t be necessary.\n\n\nSet the camera mode to aperture priority. (It may make sense later to use manual mode and dial in a shutter speed to get repeatable shots.)\n\n\nSet the aperture pretty narrow, somewhere from f/11 — f/16. A wide aperture results in a shallow depth-of-field, which actually isn’t too bad—the canvas is flat, after all. But starting with a narrow aperture is best to ensure that the finest details stay sharp.\n\n\nAt this point you can probably start shooting. You should check that the exposure and focus are ok. If they aren’t, here are some tricks:\n\n\n(Optional) If the artwork is very light or dark and you want to preserve that effect in the photo, you can use a grey card (or newspaper with big black X) as a neutral target for exposure and focusing. Trigger the camera self-timer and remove the newspaper before each shot.\n\n\n(Optional) If you want repeatable shots, you can switch to manual mode and dial in the shutter speed once you’ve seen what the camera has been selecting automatically. If you’re having trouble with the focus changing, you can also focus manually.\n\n\nReferences\nwww.vmfa.museum/teens/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2014/02/How_to_shoot_art-FINAL.pdf\nartprof.org/pro-development/art-school-portfolios/art-school-portfolios-photographing-2d-art/\nexpertphotography.com/photographing-artwork-tips/\nStitching photos\nIf you can’t get a high enough resolution in one photo, you can stitch multiple photos.\nI only tried this once and results weren’t perfect.

open-source software, for technical users, not synced to cloud, you manage your backups yourself\n\n\n\nBitwarden usage\n\nset a strong master password which encrypts the vault\nvault is automatically synced to the cloud\nclever architecture… your password never leaves your device and BitWarden has no way to decrypt your passwords\n\nmake sure you back up your master password!\n\n\nyou can use web app, browser plugin, native app, and mobile app\n\nall roughly equivalent\nplugin can auto-type the password\n\n\n\n\n\nBitwarden security architecture\n\nmaster password encrypts a longer encryption key; that key encrypts the vault\ncloud server stores hashed password (hashed), account encryption key (encrypted), and vault (encrypted)\nto log in and download, the cloud server checks the master password hash and (optional) 2fa\naccount encryption key (encrypted) and vault (encrypted) are also stored locally\nto unlock vault, master password is used to decrypt account encryption key, which is used to decrypt the vault\npart of what makes the design secure is that the encryption process happens on your computer so your password is never transmitted to BitWarden\n\n\n\nBitwarden setup\n\ndecide: will spouses use the same account or each have their own?\n\nBitwarden premium/family plan has nice features to share groups of passwords between family accounts\n\n\nsign up at bitwarden.com\nchoose a good master password\n\nhow long? recommend 6 word passphrase\n\n5 word may be ok if 2fa turned on\n4 word may be ok if only storing less-important passwords (no

lose it there is no way to recover it!\n\n\n\n\ndecide: turn on 2fa for password manager?\n\nbenefit: even if someone gets your password (via phishing attack, logging in on a public computer, keylogger malware infection, etc.) they probably won’t be able to log in and download your vault\nrisk: if you lose your 2fa method (lost phone, lost access to email address) then you lose access to log in to the account (though you can still decrypt your local copy of the vault)\nmy opinion:\n\nit’s definitely a good idea and significantly improves security\nmaybe ok to turn off if you only use Bitwarden on your own computer and laptop\nif you turn it on, you should also add a backup 2fa and keep the 2fa recovery code in a safe place, plus a copy offsite!\n\n\n\n\nadd a test entry\ninstall
